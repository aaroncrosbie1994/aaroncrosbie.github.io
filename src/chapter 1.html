<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>The average day would start off by attempting to arise from bed at an appropriate hour, let's say 7am. Now as all college
    students would know from personal experience, there is nothing more difficult in life than having to leave the comfort of ones bed.
    This is more so the case in the winter months as the cold makes you want to cling onto your duvet for dear life. After finally
    mustering the will power to leave your cocoon of happiness you would only then realise it is now in fact 8am and you realise you have
    to be in college for a 9am lecture. Panic ensues and before you know it you're ready and the clock hasn't even hit 8.15am, you're not
    in the clear yet though as you still have to make the bus (that is unless you're one of the privileged few to drive to college).
    Following a stressful half jog to the bus stop you find yourself just missing the bus which will have you arriving in college for 8.50am,
    The cold reality sinks in and you know you will have to face being late yet again for your 9am lecture. To make matters worse a morning coffee
    is still yet to be consumed, making the ability to pay attention for a full two hour lecture next to impossible.
