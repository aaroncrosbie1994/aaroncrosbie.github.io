<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>After hurrying out the lecture room doors the only thought that is going through your head is your desperate need for
    a coffee, the canteen is only a 5 minute walk away but to you that's 5 minutes you just don't know if you can wait.
    The long walk across campus has really taken it out of you and now you find yourself at an impasse, do you go home?
    Or do you ride out the oncoming storm of labs and additional lectures. After drinking the glorious elixir of life known
    as a cappuccino you find the will power to go on and head to your lab, once arriving you take a seat and open todays lab
    sheet which you must complete. The document opens and horror fills your face, you recall oversleeping last week for a certain
    lecture and said lecture covered all the material relevant for todays lab work. Looking around you notice all other students
    in the lab are furiously typing away like monkeys attempting to recreate a work of Shakespeare, this has been the final straw
    and you finally admit defeat. As you walk to the bus stop reevaluating your life choices all you can think of is how productive
    you in fact were today, An average day of college says you.
