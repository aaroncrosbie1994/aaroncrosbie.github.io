<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>You arrive to college at roughly 9.30am, nerves begin to rise as you stare down the double door
    to the lecture hall. After wiping the sweat from your brow you muster all the courage you have and swing open
    the door. All eyes fall upon you and to make matters worse as you enter the room you notice just
    to your right the lecturer is staring right at you with a cold look almost questioning why you'd
    bother coming to class if you were late. With tears beginning to fill your tired eyes you
    quickly find your way to the closest available seat and plant yourself in it, never once does your head rise and you already
    regret leaving the comfort and safety of your bed. Sitting there for what feels like an eternity you reach for your phone
    to check the time and to your dismay you find that what was an eternity in your mind was in fact only fifteen minutes. With
    still an hour left how will I survive? you think to yourself, just as you being to come to terms with what is possibly the
    closest to hell you will ever come, you hear rustling. Raising your head it is no apparent that the lecturer had finished this
    presentation.
